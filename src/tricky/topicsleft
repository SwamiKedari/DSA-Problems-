graphs :
hamiltonian path
disjoint set union
shortest distance questions

dp:
dp on trees
dp on partitions
palindrome partitioning can be done in o(n*n), explore the procedure
finding count of palindromic substrings (can be done greedily and also can be done using dp, explore it)

trees:
constructing the tree using the preorder and the inorder traversal
iterative traversals of the tree (done)
path related problems in the trees (done)

other:
cycle detection in the linkedlist
finding the ncr and the pascal's triangle (done)
finding the maximum xor subset within the numbers
lru cache implementation
